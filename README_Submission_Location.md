The purpose of this assignment was to do portfolio analysis and comparison of a given data set. 

In the second portion of the assignment, I was to create a new portfolio, called the MAZZUCA FUND, and compare and analyze it to the original given portfolio data.

The final submission of my code for my analysis can be found in the Starter_Code directory in the whale_analysis.ipynb file.
